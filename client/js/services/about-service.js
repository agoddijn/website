  var longDescription = "My name is Alexander Goddijn. I was born in the city of Amsterdam, moved to London at age 4, and moved back to Amsterdam age 13 where I completed my high school education (International Baccalaureate). I am the son of Harold Goddijn and Corinne Vigreux, co-founders of the highly successful technology company TomTom. Through my proximity to TomTom I have had the amazing opportunity of experiencing the growth of a major technology company from its infancy. This has made my understanding of product almost instinctive. Through my youth I was always fascinated by physics and have been driven by a desire to understand the fundamental building blocks of our reality. I apply this motivation and the skills gained from studying physics and engineering to the product world. I work by understanding the fundamental 'why' of a product, and allow it to guide me through all stages of product development.";
