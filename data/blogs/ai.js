  content: "<p>The advent of AI is ushering in a brave new world. The days of skynet are virtually upon us. I read an <a href='http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/inventions/robotics-scientist-warns-of-terrifying-future-as-world-powers-embark-on-ai-arms-race/news-story/d61a1ce5ea50d080d595c1d9d0812bbe'>article</a> this morning about scientists warning of the potential repercussions of an AI arms race. Many prominent figures in science and the tech industry have signed a petition pleading governments not to enter such a race, for the fear of what AI weapons could do in the wrong hands.</p><p>There is a lot of fear surrounding the topic of AI, and rightfully so. Popular media has always portrayed the rise of AI as the downfall of the human race, and warned of its potential consequences, long before the technology started to become viable. The idea of creating an entity more capable than people and with a free will of it’s own is justifiably scary. History has often seen the extinction of a species by a more powerful one.</p><p>But there are two sides to this coin. The correct and safe implementation of AI algorithms could benefit many. We are already seeing AI algorithms used in autonomous vehicles to tackle the issues of pollution and congestion in cities. Developments in AI algorithms will lead to significant improvements in medicine, heavy industry, aviation, and will save lives and reduce the cost of production, thereby increasing standards of living. Facebook and Google already use a blend of AI algorithms to determine advertisements and content for users, creating a huge impact on global and local economies and social movements.</p><p>AI algorithms will be able to work smarter, faster, and cheaper than most people. This of course raises some very valid concerns about the future of <a href='http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety'>employment</a>. Already we are starting to see jobs replaced by AI. Although this will make products cheaper, wealth will be even more unequally distributed. As companies start to get smaller, and revenues start to increase, wealth inequality will become a serious issue, and those who own the means of production, the licences to AI algorithms, will profit enormously. There will need to be a drastic change in social policy if everyone’s standard of living is to increase off the use of AI. Several countries are already trialling <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/01/universal-basic-income-trials-being-considered-in-scotland'>universal basic income</a>, a system where every citizen has the right to a basic wage, regardless of employment status.</p><p>These issues are all a result of the current state of AI technology, and it is increasing at a fast rate. But it could be argued that the path this will lead us down in the long run is even more frightening. </p><p>Suppose the ‘singularity’ is created, an AI that is more intelligent in every way than people, that has free will and the ability to influence the world around it. It would not face the same biological limitations we do. The rate of evolution of such a software would be orders of magnitude greater than the limit imposed on our species by reproduction. It would never make a mistake due to anger, or fear, at least not in the same way we do. We hold the illusion that our intelligence cannot be surpassed, because we cannot imagine what other levels of intelligence would be like. Perhaps an analogy can help with this. It’s possible, likely even, that an AI could become relatively smarter to humans than humans are to ants, with capabilities beyond anything we could imagine. As such, would it could treat us like we treat ants. We assume an AI would turn on humanity out of anger, but what if it did not turn on us at all, and squashed us out of indifference.</p><p>It is obvious we must be careful in pursuing this technology, but at the same time, I am of the belief that Murphy’s law, i.e. whatever can happen will happen, will lead to the creation of a true AI whether we try to limit it or not. I think we are still some ways away from this being realisable, but we must be prepared for a future where we are no longer the dominant species, the apex predator. The future may look very different to what we assume.</p><p>This paints a bleak picture, but even knowing this, I am excited for the potential applications of AI currently. We could see major breakthroughs on cures for various life threatening diseases in our lifetimes due to its advent. It is already revolutionising our solutions to mobility, and it will continue to make production cheaper, more efficient, and of a higher quality. I don’t know what the future holds for us, but whatever it brings I will take in with an open but wary mind.</p>"
