  content: "<p>While I’m waiting for inspiration for future blog posts to strike I thought I’d include a more personal introduction here. Obviously, this website is designed to showcase my academic and professional ability, but more than that, I want it to be a small window into my experiences and beliefs.</p><p>I have spent a lot of time and energy trying to make sense of my experiences, and construct my beliefs, and in hindsight I did this is a very inorganic fashion. I have always actively tried to decide exactly what it is I believe in, perhaps in a search for some inherent purpose and direction in my existence. That sounds very philosophical but I think it’s an issue many people either consciously or subconsciously deal with on some level. I mean, religion was basically invented to answer this very question, so it must be one that has plagued mankind since at least pre-50th millennium BCE (the first observed instances of religious practices).</p><p>I live now in a post-religious environment, accepting instead what is arguably a different doctrine, science. But the same questions arose, so I went searching for the answer in the only place I knew where. I spent a lot of time trying to understand the natural laws that govern us, and tried to apply them to my experience. It follows that if these laws govern my reality, they must also govern my experience thereof. But this creates a cognitive dissonance. We have been taught to believe that we exist independently of the world. We think of ourselves as the subjective, and everything else as the objective. But if you follow the logic of the laws of physics to their end goal, it does not make sense to separate ourselves from the rest of our physical reality. So, what’s the missing piece, a soul?</p><p>If we preclude the soul in our model of the universe on the basis that it is not physically observable, then we conclude that we live in a deterministic, fully automatic universe, without the existence of free will… whoa hold on. A life without free will. That sounds like a strange concept, because of course we have free will. But logically we find that we do not. So how does one overcome this cognitive dissonance? At this point I was stuck for a while. Being stuck in this state has some side effects, like reading lots of eastern philosophy, burning incense in your room, and walking around like you have no idea if you’re dreaming or not. It takes up a lot of energy, and there is no easy solution.</p><p>After struggling with this for a while a kind of apathy sets in, and it is a struggle to find motivation to do or care about anything. And then, suddenly, an epiphany. Does it matter whether I have free will, whether I have a purpose? I was listening to a podcast by Alan Watts (because that’s what one does when struggling with these questions) and he said two things that struck me. Firstly, it is not constructive to look to practices of other cultures to reach a state of inner peace, one must follow the rules set out by one’s own culture, and eventually a change will come about. That seems counter intuitive. How can the competitive rat race of western society be conducive to inner peace? (please remember I use the term inner peace here to loosely convey the state we hope to achieve). Then he said the second thing that struck me. Life is essentially playful. It has no inherent purpose, just as a piece of music or a dance does not, but we do it for the sake of doing it, for play.</p><p>Now I am going to try and avoid sayings like ‘being one with the universe’, because these often have negative connotations of hippies smoking pot and saying shit that’s just completely wrong, but in that moment, I came to understand that we are not just one with the universe, we are the universe, in its most beautifully complex form, and that all we experience is essentially play.</p><p>A Dutch spreekwoord comes to mind, ‘niet lullen maar poetsen’ which roughly translates to, just get on with it. What I mean by this is that in this epiphany I came to realise the uselessness of actively seeking meaning and a belief system. You just have to keep playing, and then these things come naturally. It’s a very liberating realisation, and productive too. My energy is now spent on doing rather than going through a cyclical process of self-analysis and reflection.</p><p>I think the rest of my family figured this out way before I did. I have an incredible family. Brilliant parents, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, speakers, writers, and good, warm hearted people. It’s not a large family, but all these qualities are present in high concentration. It’s a special group, and often feels very separate from the rest of the world. I am incredibly thankful for them. Being in this family has given me many experiences, from motorcycling across Iceland, to sailing a J class in regattas all over the world. I have seen many cultures and groups with experiences that could not be more different from mine, and have learnt a little something from all of them. It makes me want to travel more, and after I graduate I think I that’s what I will do. I love literature, film, music, and most things creative. I say most because there’s definitely a lot of shit out there. I’m interested in, but not passionate about politics, and I have a hard time caring about PC culture, probably because I’m not directly affected by it, although I know a lot who are.</p><p>This is a brief introduction, and a bit rushed, but I don’t want to drag on. I guess the most important thing I want to express is how I see the world. I know there’s a lot of people out there who experience depression, and I have myself touched that state. For some people it’s more difficult than others, there are biological factors, and circumstantial influences, but I think a lot of it comes down to how you see the world, and in the end you just have to play the game ;)</p>"
