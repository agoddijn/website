  content: "<p>The resistance to autonomous driving has always surprised me. Whenever I ask what people think of it, I get a variety of uncertain answers. The thing I hear the most is that people would miss driving. But would they? Imagine all the time you spend driving, and what you could do instead. You could read a book, take an important call, play video games, or otherwise pass the time. What if you want to go downtown and drink? Now your car can drive you there and drive you back. You could drive all night and feel rested in the morning when you arrive because you’ve slept the entire way. These are just a few use cases and already I’m getting excited. </p><p>An important point is you would not have to give up the driving experience if you don’t want to. Autonomous vehicles will, for the foreseeable future, be equipped with a steering wheel for manual takeover. It’s the best of both worlds. So it’s obvious there are many advantages for the driver, but what about the impact of driverless technology on a more global scale.</p><p>Firstly, theres the obvious aspect of safety. It is likely, and in fact currently statistically proven, that driverless vehicles are safer, for both passengers and pedestrians, than a human driver. It doesn’t get tired, it doesn’t get angry, and it’s faster and smarter than a person. It can make decisions based on millions of hours worth of driving data, experience that you as a driver may not have. It’s a technology that will literally and visibly save lives. </p><p>Then there is the impact on the urban environment. Roads would be less congested as driverless vehicles communicate with each other to optimise traffic flow. Parking would no longer be necessary, or would change format entirely. You would get dropped of by your vehicle and it would then come and pick you up, in the meantime parking in a designated autonomous parking warehouse, perhaps outside the city centre. You may no longer ever need to own a vehicle. Sharing autonomous transportation between people would create a highly efficient transportation network that could rival and replace the traditional transportation system.</p><p>We may no longer have to build our cities around our cars. Driverless technology could completely change the way we think about the urban environment and, once again, make space for people the number one priority, whilst retaining mobility and efficiency. Imagine if all road area, currently reserved for parking, was taken up by cafe terraces and patios in the summer, and the impact this would have on social integration.</p><p>All in all, a driverless future would look, and feel, much more organic, and community oriented. Gone will be the dominance of the conventional car, and a new utopian era of transportation will be ushered in.</p><p>This may be hyperbolising a bit, but having lived in Amsterdam, where bike and tram traffic dominates, and comparing it with Vancouver, I have felt firsthand the effect that a pedestrian oriented urban space can have. It makes a world of difference, a world I would love to live in.</p>"
