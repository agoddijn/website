  content: "<p>Mobility plays a huge role on the way we lead our lives. It governs where we work and live, the way we plan our cities, and the way we use our urban spaces. For as long as I can remember transportation has been dominated by cars, or rather, it has dominated our transportation. It has been the only viable solution to getting from A to B efficiently. But it comes at a great cost. Cars pollute our air, congest our cities, and cause thousands of deaths every year in traffic accidents. I believe that in addition to this, they have had a detrimental effect on the way we behave socially.</p><p>I grew up in Amsterdam, a city dominated by bike and tram traffic. There are very few cars in the city centre, and the ones we do have are designed as urban vehicles; small, slow, and with short range. The difference a city without cars makes is surprising, and perhaps more subtle than one might expect. Other than the increased traffic flow, fewer cars offers urban space back to the people. Cafes put terraces on the sidewalks, on special occasions the streets are filled with stands of people selling second hand items, and the roads become impassable to vehicles. A sense of community closeness permeates the atmosphere, and the sound of people talking and laughing replaces the constant drone of engines. A city without cars lights up, and brings people closer together. </p><p>Moving to north America put this style of living in stark contrast. Here, the road is king. Cars zip aggressively back and forth, the tarmac takes up a lot of available space, and around 80% of road space is taken by unused parked cars. But I believe the imminent revolution of the automotive industry with autonomous driving will help change this.</p><p>A city in which the autonomous vehicle is widely adopted will look vastly different. Parking will change completely, as peoples cars will drop them off, drive to a remote parking location, and pick them up again on request. This will free space taken by unused vehicles, and will eliminate traffic caused by people driving around in circles looking for parking. Traffic flow will be greatly increased, and will become responsive to road changes, as a network of driverless vehicles will communicate with each other to optimise road use, allowing passengers to reach their destinations in a fraction of the time. Fewer people will own cars, as the costs of car sharing become more and more affordable. After owning a house, owning a car is likely the most expensive purchase in a persons life, and a lot of that money will be freed up.</p><p> It will also change and perhaps replace conventional public transportation systems, as fleets of small electric autonomous vehicles distributed around cities will be able to transport passengers in a highly efficient manner. Any car on the road will be in constant use, making usage extremely efficient. Additionally, the ever present issue of safety will see a vast improvement, as driverless vehicles will be, and in fact already are, much safer than human drivers. The urban environment will once again become a space for people. </p><p>But what about the adoption of this brave new technology? There seems to be some resistance, especially people saying that they want to be able to drive. Of course that option will still always be available in autonomous vehicles, but I believe the newer generations will find driving less and less appealing. It is estimated that most people born today will never need to get a drivers licence. The problem of congestion and pollution in urban environments is a big one, and its when new technologies solve real problems that they are quickly adopted.</p><p>I have felt the effects of a city without cars first hand, and I truly believe driverless cars will bring us closer to that. It is a world I would love to live in.</p>"
