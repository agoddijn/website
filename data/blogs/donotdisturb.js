  content: "<p>The internet, a blessing and a curse.  Mostly a blessing of course, but it seems increasingly obvious that our relationship with the net is not entirely healthy. We spend far too much time looking at our phones, sucked into the void of our facebook newsfeeds,  an endless source of vapid entertainment,  curated by an artificially intelligent algorithm with the sole purpose of keeping you trapped in the cycle. More views, more likes, more revenue. I paint a bleak picture but not, I think, an unwarranted one.</p><p>Before we start with the argument to emotion, lets figure out if there is actually a problem. It seems that we increasingly hear stories of young adults who suffer from depression, often in silence, and sometimes with dramatic endings. Is this because of phones? There is obviously the direct link of cyber bullying, people that have been socially tormented by internet users who feel emboldened by their sense of anonymity. There are the stereotypes of people who’s entire self worth is the image they present of themselves on certain social media platforms. I’m talking about the people for whom the number of likes they receive on an Instagram photo would be a good quantifier of how well their day went. These are extreme cases, and in these cases it is obvious that their relationships with social media are unhealthy. But what about the average Joe. What about those who just have Facebook (which at this point I suspect is most of us) but wouldn’t seem to fall under the category of obsessive user.</p><p>I consider myself the average user when it comes to Facebook, and I wanted to try and understand the impact it has on my time, and on my life. So I quit. Just kidding, I don’t think I’m ready to commit online social suicide, and I don’t see Facebook as having such a devastating impact on my life that I should quit cold turkey, like it’s heroin or something. What I did do however, was incredibly simple and surprisingly effective. I put my phone settings on <i>do not disturb</i>.</p><p>I’m not going to claim that my life changed dramatically, but it did change, and for the better. Here is what I noticed about being on <i>do not disturb</i>.  Firstly, you begin to forget about your connection to the rest of the net. Without the bleeping, buzzing, and vibrating constantly reminding you that you’re connected, or that you’re horribly alone and no one wants to talk to you, it becomes much easier to focus on now, on what you’re doing in that moment. The ability to focus on just one thing is something that you don’t realise you’ve lost until you get it back. </p><p>For me this was already a huge step in the right direction, and a very simple, easy change, one setting on your phone. The next thing you become aware of is how potently all consuming Facebook can be once you’re back in front of the screen. It’s actually quite scary, and is probably the first subtle sign that skynet is taking over the world. The reason the feed is so engrossing is because there is an algorithm behind it that knows more about your behaviour than even you might, and the only thing it wants is for you to use more Facebook.</p><p>Now I’m not trying to tout Facebook as  the worst thing to ever have happened, but I do think our relationship with it, and with the internet and sociable media in general, has become detrimental to our general wellbeing. Of course, setting your phone permanently to <i>Do Not Disturb</i> is not an ultimate solution, but it is definitely a step in the right direction, and something I urge you to try for yourself.</p>"
