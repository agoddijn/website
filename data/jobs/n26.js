            descriptionAbove: "N26 is a mobile bank accessible on Android, iOS, and web platforms. It provides users with bank accounts and associated debit cards, and offers multiple common banking services such as credit, overdraft, and insurance. They use a freemium model to bring down the prices of their basic banking services, at the cost of limiting certain digital features. I worked as a product manager intern on the Bank Core team, which is responsible for the core services of the product, such as SEPA transfers, MoneyBeam, and Cash26. After 3 months I took over as product owner for this team, leading plannings, refinements, and retros. Managing the team was the most difficult part of the job, as almost every engineer in the team of 7 was new, either arriving at the same time or after me. This meant a lot of time spent familiarizing the team with the codebase and architecture. This was compounded by ongoing technical debt and dealing with fire fighting, which broke up the main themes of our sprints making it difficult for the team to gain cohesion and momentum. It also made prioritization of features over technical debt challenging. These challenges taught me a lot about the value of recording data and making data driven decisions, as well as leading and motivating a team",
