            descriptionAbove: "The role of forward deployed engineer is a mix of client facing consulting and technical implementation. My first deployment was at a pharmaceutical company, where we were responsible for creating a proof of concept showing we could ingest large datasets from various proprietary sources and perform meaningful analysis on that data. We were able to deliver the necessary capabilities despite some limitations of the platform, and the proof of concept converted into a full conttract to host a section of their drug discovery process on the platform. After this I did another pilot in the automotive manufactuiring space, and tried to consolidate a fractured planning process into a single platform, giving users insights into the various stages and states of orders and stock within the planning cycle. Lastly, I led a team on the Airbus project to provide operational analytics on certain parts of the manufacturing process.",
